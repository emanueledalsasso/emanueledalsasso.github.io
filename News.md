With the team of engineers of <a href="https://www.hi-paris.fr/">Hi! Paris</a> we just released a python package called <a href="https://github.com/hi-paris/deepdespeckling">deepdespeckling</a> on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/deepdespeckling/">Pypi</a>. It currently implements <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13148.pdf">MERLIN<a/> for TerraSAR-X Stripmap and HighRes SpotLight data. The package will be constantly updated.
