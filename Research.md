## Post-doctoral researcher
<span class="subheading-ED"> October 2023 - ongoing </span>
Currently with the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/en/eceo/">ECEO lab</a>
of EPFL. Working with <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/devis.tuia">Devis Tuia</a> and <a href="https://marcrusswurm.com/">Marc Rußwurm</a> on 
<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/eceo/projects/">ADOPT: AI for Detecting Ocean Plastic Pollution with Tracking</a>, 
a project founded by the Swiss Data Science Center. 

## Post-doctoral researcher
<span class="subheading-ED"> September 2022 - September 2023 </span>
During my post-doc under ASTRAL project (Apprentissage StaTistique pour l’imageRie sAr muLtidimensionnelle), funded by the joint ASTRID program of ANR and AID, I worked with <a href="https://cedric.cnam.fr/~rambourc/">Clément Rambour</a> and <a href="https://cedric.cnam.fr/~thomen/">Nicolas Thome</a> on self-supervised learning for representation learning in remote sensing.


## Post-doctoral researcher
<span class="subheading-ED"> March 2022 - September 2022 </span>
During my post-doc with <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/">Florence Tupin</a> and <a href="https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/deniloic/">Loïc Denis</a> I worked on network architectures suitable for multi-dimensional complex SAR data (in particular polarimetric SAR data).

## Ph.D candidate
<span class="subheading-ED"> January 2019 - March 2022 </span>
The subject of my Ph.D was: "Deep Learning for SAR imagery: from denoising to scene understanding". Throughout
my Ph.D thesis, I have explored supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning approaches for speckle reduction from Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The fluctuations
caused by speckle seriously limit the exploitation of SAR data. The speckle phenomenon has a deterministic yet unpredictable phenomenon: it is often modeled as a random variable and
treated as a multiplicative noise. At first, we proposed to create a dataset of groundtruth images to train a deep model for speckle reduction, namely <a href="https://gitlab.telecom-paris.fr/ring/SAR-CNN">SAR-CNN</a>.
To account for specific acquisition modality, introducing speckle spatial correlation, we then introduce a semi-supervised approach to train neural networks directly on SAR data: <a href="https://gitlab.telecom-paris.fr/ring/SAR2SAR">SAR2SAR</a>.
The algorithm relies on the noise2noise framework and on SAR time-series. However, one does not always have access to more images acquired over a same area. With <a href="https://gitlab.telecom-paris.fr/ring/MERLIN">MERLIN</a> we show
that, somehow counterintuitively, one can exploit the phase of a single-look complex SAR image to produce two independent subimages, namely the real and the imaginary part, creating ideal conditions to
perform unsupervised learning on single SAR images.
