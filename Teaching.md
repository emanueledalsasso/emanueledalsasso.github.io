## 2024 - 2025
- Supervising the Master's thesis of Michelangelo Mussini on the correlation between environmental variables and marine debris outflow in river deltas: a study involving the use of multi-modal remote sensing data and deep learning
- Teaching assistant for the EPFL Master's course [Image Processing for Earth Observation](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/image-processing-for-earth-observation-ENV-540) (14h)
- Supervising the semester project of Samuel Darmon on uncertainty estimation of segmentation models of floating debris. The project investigates the sensitivity of the model to the spectral information.
- Co-supervising with Marc Russwurm the Master's thesis of Gabriele Tijunaityte on siamese network for matching of floating material between PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images acquire at a short time distance.
- Teaching assistant for the EPFL Master's course [Sensing and spatial modeling for earth observation](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/sensing-and-spatial-modeling-for-earth-observation-ENV-408): 12h + 2h of lecture

## 2023 - 2024
- Co-supervising the Master's thesis of Manon Cécile Nicole Béchaz with Devis Tuia and Marc Rußwurm. She is investigating the use of physical models and hybrid model for tracking buoys in the ocean from metereological data. Her project is a preliminary study for ADOPT's project which will focus on the more challenging problem of tracking floating plastic litter.
